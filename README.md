# zuul-core

# Important
This is my implementation of a game of same name, made by me (in java - blueJ) for OOP subject At university. Since i really like the idea of this game, i will reimplement using C# core, using a console application. The original project was to create a game, based on World of zuul.

Aparently i really like making games, so i created Detective zuul...

# Concepts
In Detective zuul you are zuul, a detective who will walk in the crime scene, collect every evidence possible to solve the mistery.

In this text based game, you will explore a 3D-ish world, so pick up a compass, grap a map, and solve this mistery!

# How to instal

## Developer mode
Since this game is not complete yet, you have to compile the game. it's not hard. Install [dotnet core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download), following the instructions for your operational system, then clone (or download) the project.

Open a command prompt, resize to fit the entire screen, and enter the project directory. Then execute ```dotnet run```. The game will start.
